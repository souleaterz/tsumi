# 罪 Tsumi — Deployment Guide

Step-by-step to take Tsumi from the GitHub repo to a live, fully-featured deploy on
Vercel with auth, persistence, and payments wired up.

> **Tip:** the app runs with *zero* config (AniList needs no key). You can deploy
> first and add Supabase / Clerk / Stripe incrementally — each activates on its own
> once its env vars are present.

---

## 0. Prerequisites

- The repo is pushed to `github.com/souleaterz/tsumi` (done ✅).
- Accounts: [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Supabase](https://supabase.com),
  [Clerk](https://clerk.com), [Stripe](https://stripe.com). All have free tiers.

---

## 1. Deploy to Vercel (no keys — gets you a live URL)

1. Go to **vercel.com → Add New → Project**.
2. **Import** `souleaterz/tsumi`. Vercel auto-detects Next.js — leave build settings default.
3. Click **Deploy**. In ~2 min you get a URL like `https://tsumi-xxxx.vercel.app`.
4. Open it — the home page, browse, search, and anime details all work on live AniList data.

Set this env var now so absolute URLs (OG tags, sitemap, Stripe redirects) are correct:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | your Vercel URL, e.g. `https://tsumi-xxxx.vercel.app` |

> Add env vars in **Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**, then
> **redeploy** (Deployments → ⋯ → Redeploy) for them to take effect.

---

## 2. Supabase — watchlist, history, progress

1. **supabase.com → New project.** Pick a region near your users; save the DB password.
2. **SQL Editor → New query** → paste the contents of
   [`lib/supabase/schema.sql`](lib/supabase/schema.sql) → **Run**. This creates the
   `watchlist`, `watch_progress`, and `subscriptions` tables with RLS enabled.
3. **Project Settings → API** — copy these into Vercel env:

| Key | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Settings → API → Project URL | public |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Settings → API → `anon` `public` key | public |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Settings → API → `service_role` key | **server-only, secret** |

> The service-role key is used only server-side (`lib/subscription.ts`, the Stripe
> webhook). Never expose it to the client.

---

## 3. Clerk — authentication

1. **clerk.com → Create application.** Enable the sign-in methods you want
   (email, Google, etc.).
2. **API Keys** — copy into Vercel env:

| Key | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Clerk → API Keys → Publishable key |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Clerk → API Keys → Secret key |

3. Add these (already the app defaults, but set them explicitly):

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` | `/sign-in` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` | `/sign-up` |

4. **Connect Clerk → Supabase (required for per-user persistence).** Without this,
   Supabase RLS rejects the writes and data silently falls back to `localStorage`.
   - In **Clerk → Configure → Integrations**, enable the **Supabase** integration
     (or, on older dashboards, add a JWT template named `supabase`).
   - In **Supabase → Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Third-Party Auth**, add
     **Clerk** as a provider and paste your Clerk domain.
   - The app's `SupabaseBridge` then injects the Clerk session token on every Supabase
     request, and RLS matches `auth.jwt()->>'sub'` to `user_id`.

After redeploy, `/profile` becomes a protected route and the watchlist/history persist
to Supabase per user.

---

## 4. Stripe — Tsumi Pro (£0.99/mo)

1. **Stripe Dashboard → Products → Add product.**
   - Name: `Tsumi Pro`
   - Price: **£0.99 / month**, recurring. **Save**, then copy the **Price ID**
     (`price_…`) — this is the real charge amount (the UI figure is display-only).
2. **Developers → API keys** — copy the secret key.
3. Add to Vercel env:

| Key | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Developers → API keys → Secret key |
| `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID` | the `price_…` from step 1 |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Developers → API keys → Publishable key |

4. **Webhook** — Developers → Webhooks → **Add endpoint**:
   - URL: `https://YOUR_APP_URL/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`,
     `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - Save, then copy the **Signing secret** (`whsec_…`):

| Key | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | the `whsec_…` signing secret |

The webhook mirrors subscription state into Supabase `subscriptions`; `getProStatus()`
reads it server-side to skip ads and unlock 1080p+ for Pro users.

> **Test mode first:** use Stripe test keys + card `4242 4242 4242 4242`. Switch to
> live keys when ready.

## 4b. Real-Debrid — REQUIRED for video playback

In-browser torrent streaming (WebTorrent) **cannot play most public anime torrents** —
browsers only peer over WebRTC, and those swarms have none. Real-Debrid fixes this:
Torrentio returns direct HTTPS streams for cached torrents that play natively.

1. Sign up at [real-debrid.com](https://real-debrid.com) (~£3/mo).
2. Get your API token at **[real-debrid.com/apitoken](https://real-debrid.com/apitoken)**.
3. Add to Vercel env (**server-only secret** — never exposed to the browser):

| Key | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `REALDEBRID_API_KEY` | real-debrid.com/apitoken |

Redeploy. The watch page now resolves cached torrents to HTTPS via Real-Debrid; the
player streams them directly with no WebTorrent. The app server-side-resolves the final
RD link and redirects the browser to it, so the key never leaves the server.

> Sources marked ⚡ are RD-cached (instant). Uncached torrents may need RD to download
> first. The source picker prefers cached + highest quality.

## 5. (Optional) Pre-roll ads & source endpoints

| Key | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMA_AD_TAG` | _(unset)_ | Google IMA ad tag URL for real pre-roll inventory. Without it, free tier shows a 5s house placeholder. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TORRENTIO_BASE` | `https://torrentio.strem.fun` | override if self-hosting Torrentio |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANIZIP_BASE` | `https://api.ani.zip` | AniList→Kitsu mapping |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NYAA_BASE` | `https://nyaa.si` | fallback source resolver |

---

## 6. Final redeploy & verification

1. With all env vars set, **redeploy** in Vercel.
2. Verify:
   - [ ] Home renders trending anime (live AniList).
   - [ ] Sign up via `/sign-in` → redirected to `/profile`.
   - [ ] Add an anime to your watchlist → reload → it persists (Supabase, not just localStorage).
   - [ ] Open an episode under `/watch/...` → free tier shows the pre-roll, then the player.
   - [ ] `/profile` → **Upgrade to Pro** → complete Stripe test checkout → return shows
         "Tsumi Pro Active"; the pre-roll no longer appears and 1080p sources unlock.
   - [ ] `https://YOUR_APP_URL/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`, and `/opengraph-image` all load.
